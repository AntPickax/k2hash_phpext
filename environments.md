# Environments
K2HASH PHP Extension library does not define its own environment variable.
However, the environment variable defined by [K2HASH](https://k2hash.antpick.ax/) is loaded into K2HASH PHP Extension library through it.
For information on these environment variables, please see [here](https://k2hash.antpick.ax/environments.html).
